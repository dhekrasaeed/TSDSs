0,"@USAirways After today,no reason 4 anyone to not approve merger with @AmericanAir,other airlines have no reason to fear losing business to U"
0,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?

0,@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
0,@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.

0,@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
0,@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
0,@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
0,@USAirways HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice
0,@AmericanAir thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today

0,"@AmericanAir Uhmmm we need @JColeNC down in Dallas,Tx for his tour üò´üò´üò´"
0,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0,@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
0,"@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?"
0,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
0,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
0,@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
0,@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.

0,@JetBlue everyone is overreacting. Keep up your swag!

0,@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
0,@JetBlue it was but obviously it wasn't linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it.
